Source code to a funny little Chrome plugin that replaces instances of Donald Trump to the anagram Lord Dampnut.
100% inspired by Colin Mochrie's [tweet](https://twitter.com/colinmochrie/status/822608605434302464?lang=en).

I haven't released to the Chrome Store since this was just something I created for my own amusement. If you want to use it, 
follow the instructions below:

## Loading the extension

1. Visit chrome://extensions in your browser (or open up the Chrome menu by clicking the icon to the far right of the Omnibox:  The menu's icon is three horizontal bars. and select Extensions under the Tools menu to get to the same place).
2. Ensure that the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click Load unpacked extensionâ€¦ to pop up a file-selection dialog.
4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live, and select it.
5. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the directory where your extension files live onto chrome://extensions in your browser to load it.

## Notes
The plugin works on most sites. I spent a grand total of 10 min on the plugin and didn't get a chance to dig in further. 
I would happily accept a pull request if you have a fix.
